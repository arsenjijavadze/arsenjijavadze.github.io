Hi — I'm Arsen. I write about infrastructure, software, DevOps and Linux. This blog documents experiments, quick hot-tos and notes for myself - and hopefully useful snippets for others.
Goals:
- Show practical demos
- Keep posts short and useful 

Engineer with a passion for Linux systems, backend technologies, and infrastructure automation.
